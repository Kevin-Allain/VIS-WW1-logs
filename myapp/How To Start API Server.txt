The functioning of the program is fairly simple:
The data is stored on a local mongoDB database. Additional information about it are private and are currently stored on a personal file. 
This program is an API that uses express to make GET requests to the database. Those can then be called within the file index.html, with an additional GET request. 
This form allows for dynamic changes on the front-end without the need to restart the back-end server (express could allow to directly do back and front-end otherwise).
To start the back-end server, run the following command, inside the folder myapp: set DEBUG=myapp:* & npm start
(the debug part isn't necessary but can be useful)
The back-end runs on the localhost port 3000. It currently requires to allow Access-Control-Allow-Origin. We use an add-on on Chrome for this.
